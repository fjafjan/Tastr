# Tastr is a tasty app

Tastr is an webapp for comparing different foods based on paired matchups. So instead of tasting eight different cheeses, and saying which one you like best, you repeatedly try two different cheeses, and eventuelly the cream rises to the top.

## Technologies

Tastr is written in Typescript, and uses Express for its backend, and React-Native for its front-end.
